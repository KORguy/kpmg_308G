# Sizeyourself

Hi there! We are team 308G :)

How is your fashion shopping going during this disastrous pandemic?
Let me guess. Largely grounded at home, sharing the pain of the world; Perhaps shifting through some handful of friendly online malls (and meh, literally buying under 20% of what had caught your attention); Quickly losing interest in beautifying beneath the necessary Zoom-zone; and even with purchases made...
**Yes we know: half should go - for its size won't fit you**

Life is a pain, when it comes to shopping online, even with its abundance and effieciency
BUT we figured it's an easily curable one,
should you try our virtual fitting solution, **Sizeyourself**.
